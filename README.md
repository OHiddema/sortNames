# sortNames
short extra task while being offline

Input: user enters a list of names.
When the user presses a button, a sorted list of the names entered appears on the screen.

Solution:
Use a textarea element for input, because this element can handle multiple lines. When the user presses a button the sorted names are put in an unordered list.

Extra:
Put the sorted list in another textarea element instead of in an unordered list. This results in even less code!
